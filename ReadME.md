This is a full online game of hangman. 

The game is fantasy themed, and uses my personal dragon sona (or a character that represents myself), Rayva, as the main character.

A user has 10 guesses before Rayva gets too tired to fly anymore and crashes.

A user guesses letters via keypress, and if the letter is a correct guess, the spaces of the word in question are automatically filled in; if not, Rayva's animation moves to the next frame and a turn/guess is detracted from the "remaining" number.

When the game is over (regardless of win/loss), the game automatically displays the next randomly chosen word to be guessed.
